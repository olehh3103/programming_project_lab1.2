# main.py

***
This program is designed to create a map with ten movie shooting points and one starting point(which you specify at the beginning).\
All points on the map are places of shooting that took place as close as possible to the starting point
***
To run the program you have to provide it with the following data: 
* year, 
* latitude,
* longitude, 
* path to your dataset.
## Example how to run the program:
* \>>> python3 main.py 2000 49.83826 24.02324 /mnt/d/labs/locations.list
***
Now, all you have to do is wait...
